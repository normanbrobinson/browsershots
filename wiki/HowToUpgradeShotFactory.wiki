#summary How to upgrade your screenshot factory

There are two different methods of upgrading your screenshot factory, depending on how you installed it initially.

Starting with milestone:0.3-beta1, the system-wide installation with *python setup.py install* is no longer required.

== Upgrading the source code from Subversion ==

If you're running a ShotFactory with the source code from Subversion, upgrade your installation as follows.

 * Open a terminal window and *cd* into the shotfactory folder.
 * Type *svn update* and press Enter.

== Upgrading from a zip file release ==

If you're running a ShotFactory with the source code of a previous release (from a zip file) or with the binary files (including shotfactory.exe), upgrade your installation as follows.

 * Rename your old shotfactory folder.
 * Download the [http://download.browsershots.org/releases latest source release] (or [http://download.browsershots.org/binaries/ binary archive]) and unzip it.
 * If you get two folders named *shotfactory-!r977-win32* (one inside the other), move the inner folder up a level.
 * Rename the new folder from *shotfactory-!r977-win32* to *shotfactory*.
 * If you have any stand-alone browser subdirectories (e.g. IE55SP2_NT), move them from the old shotfactory folder to the new one.
